# Source repository for my (duyatfit) GitHub Page.

## What is GitHub Page?

It's a free static web hosting service from GitHub, associating with our GitHub profile.

All we need to do is to commit our web page source code into a repository named `<username>.github.io`. This one is the source code for my personal GitHub Page. The website can be accessed via a public URL: https://duyatfit.github.io.

## Why do we need it?

We need a public URL so that `poetry` can recognize and pull the packages from it.

So any web server would work.
